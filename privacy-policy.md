# Privacy Policy for Gmailer Chrome Extension

## Introduction

This privacy policy explains how Gmailer ("the extension") handles user data. Gmailer is a Chrome extension that allows users to quickly navigate between multiple Gmail accounts and their different tabs (Inbox, Sent, Spam, Trash, etc.). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency regarding any data we handle.

## Data Collection

Gmailer does **not** collect any personal information from its users. The extension only works with the Gmail URLs in your browser to help you navigate faster. No email content, login details, or personal data are collected, stored, or transmitted.

## Permissions Used

- **Tabs Permission:** This is required to update and manage the Gmail tab you are currently using, allowing smooth navigation between accounts and mailbox sections.
- **Host Permissions (https://mail.google.com/*):** This allows the extension to detect and update Gmail pages for navigation purposes only.

## Data Usage

The extension does not process or store your emails. It only changes the Gmail tabâ€™s URL to help you switch between accounts and sections. All actions are performed locally on your device.

## Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or otherwise distribute any user data to third parties. All browsing activity remains private and under your control.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected here, and we encourage users to review this page regularly for updates.
